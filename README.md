# Datafactz-Project
# Interactive Sales Dashboard

## Overview
The **Interactive Sales Dashboard** is a Python-based desktop application built using `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap` for analyzing sales data, particularly focusing on electronics products. The dashboard features various data visualization tools, such as:

- A **Pie Chart** to display the sales distribution by product.
- A **Bar Chart** to visualize the total quantity sold and revenue generated by each product, with sort functionality.
- A **Time Series Chart** to display the total quantity sold over time.

The application reads the data from an Excel file, processes and cleans the data, and then provides an interactive user interface for data exploration.

### Key Features:
- Interactive buttons to switch between different types of charts (Pie, Bar, and Time Series).
- Sorting functionality for both **Quantity** and **Revenue** bar charts (ascending or descending order).
- Data cleaning and formatting, including removal of missing values and conversion of columns into appropriate formats.
- Hover effects and labels for additional data insights in charts.
