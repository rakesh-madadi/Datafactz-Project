# Datafactz-Project
# Interactive Sales Dashboard

## Overview
The **Interactive Sales Dashboard** is a Python-based desktop application built using `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap` for analyzing sales data, particularly focusing on electronics products. The dashboard features various data visualization tools, such as:

- A **Pie Chart** to display the sales distribution by product.
- A **Bar Chart** to visualize the total quantity sold and revenue generated by each product, with sort functionality.
- A **Time Series Chart** to display the total quantity sold over time.

The application reads the data from an Excel file, processes and cleans the data, and then provides an interactive user interface for data exploration.

### Key Features:
- Interactive buttons to switch between different types of charts (Pie, Bar, and Time Series).
- Sorting functionality for both **Quantity** and **Revenue** bar charts (ascending or descending order).
- Data cleaning and formatting, including removal of missing values and conversion of columns into appropriate formats.
- Hover effects and labels for additional data insights in charts.

## Prerequisites
Before running the dashboard, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting charts)
- **Seaborn** (for enhanced chart aesthetics)
- **ttkbootstrap** (for a modern and responsive UI using `tkinter`)

1.Clone the Repository:

First, clone the repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-sales-dashboard.git

2.Prepare the Data:

Ensure that the sales data Excel file is placed in the appropriate directory. Update the file path in the script if needed:
file_path = "C:\\Users\\Rakesh Reddy\\Desktop\\sales_data.xlsx"

3.Run the Application:

You can run the application by executing the main script:
python interactive_sales_dashboard.py

4.User Interface:

The application will launch a GUI that allows you to:

Select different charts (Pie, Bar, Time Series).
Sort data in the bar charts (ascending or descending).
View data summary of total quantities sold and total revenue generated for each product.

File Structure

interactive_sales_dashboard.py - Main Python script for running the dashboard.
sales_data.xlsx - Excel file containing the sales data.
README.md - This documentation file.

Future Improvements

Add functionality to export the visualized data to a file.
Allow dynamic selection of the data file by the user.
Implement more advanced data filtering options (e.g., by date range or product category).
